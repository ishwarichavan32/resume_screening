Sure, let's break down the code step by step:

1. `import streamlit as st`: This line imports the Streamlit library and gives it the alias `st`, which is commonly used for Streamlit applications.

2. `import PyPDF2`: This imports the PyPDF2 library, which is used for handling PDF files.

3. `import pdfplumber`: This imports the pdfplumber library, which is another tool for extracting text and other information from PDF files.

4. `from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer`: This line imports the `CountVectorizer` class from Scikit-learn, which is used for converting text documents into a matrix of token counts.

5. `from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity`: This imports the `cosine_similarity` function from Scikit-learn, which calculates the cosine similarity between vectors.

6. The `st.markdown()` functions are used to define custom CSS styles for the Streamlit application. These styles define the appearance of various elements like titles, subheaders, captions, and buttons.

7. `def getResult(JD_txt, resume_txt):` defines a custom function named `getResult`. This function takes two parameters, `JD_txt` (job description text) and `resume_txt` (resume text).

8. Inside the `getResult` function, the job description text and resume text are combined into a list called `content`.

9. `CountVectorizer()` creates an instance of the CountVectorizer class.

10. `matrix = cv.fit_transform(content)` converts the text documents in `content` into a matrix of token counts.

11. `cosine_similarity(matrix)` calculates the cosine similarity between the matrices of token counts for the job description and the resume.

12. `match = similarity_matrix[0][1] * 100` calculates the similarity between the job description and the resume and converts it into a percentage.

13. `return round(match, 2)` returns the similarity match percentage rounded to two decimal places.

14. The next section defines the layout of the Streamlit application using various `st.markdown()` functions to display titles, subheaders, and captions.

15. `uploadedJD = st.file_uploader("Upload Job Description (PDF)", type="pdf")` and `uploadedResume = st.file_uploader("Upload Resume (PDF)", type="pdf")` create file uploaders for uploading the job description and resume PDF files, respectively.

16. `click = st.button("Process")` creates a button labeled "Process".

17. The `if` statement checks if both the job description and resume PDF files have been uploaded and if the "Process" button has been clicked.

18. Inside the `if` statement, the job description and resume PDF files are processed using pdfplumber to extract text from the first page of each PDF.

19. The `getResult` function is then called with the extracted job description and resume text as arguments, and the resulting match percentage is displayed using `st.markdown()`.

20. Finally, a footer is displayed with the names of the developers who created the application.
